DO NOT USE THIS CODE. IT IS OLD AND INCOMPLETE

I found that the only Gems for accessing Youtube were 'youtube-g' and 'youtube', both of which didn't do what I wanted (scraping everything, including comments, related videos, etc) and weren't currently maintained.

So I'm going to try and make a more modern and useful YouTube Ruby Gem since Google often ignores Ruby programmers.

My first tasks are to make it so that we can extract data from YouTube, since I'm mainly using this for datamining.

###### Basic Example #####

require 'rubygems'
require 'main.rb'

username = 'tibbon'
user = Youtube::User.new(username)

# Print various user data. Look to /examples/example.rb for full listing of methods

p user.username         # Username
p user.first_name       # First Name
p user.last_name        # Last Name
p user.age              # Age
